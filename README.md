# Welcome to my Hangman game! Writen on Java 10

## You can start the game from the Application.java file at the src\hangman folder.

There are 3 categories that you can choose from:
* Football teams
* Books
* Programming principles

Every time you guess a word/phrase you gain points and continue the game.

You start with 10 attempts for a single word/phrase. With every correct word/phrase the attempts are reset. When you hit 0 the game is over!
